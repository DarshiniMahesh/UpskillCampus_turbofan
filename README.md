# Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction (upskillcampus_turbofan)

Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan (jet) engines using time-series sensor data. This project ingests historical multivariate sensor readings, processes them, trains predictive models, and provides a user-facing interface for inference.

## Overview

Turbofan engines degrade over time, and predicting their Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is critical for condition-based maintenance and avoiding costly failures. This project experiments with time-series modeling techniques (e.g. recurrent neural networks, transformers, or gradient boosting on features) to forecast RUL given sensor histories and operational settings.

Through preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment in a small app, this repository demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for predictive maintenance of turbofan systems.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for multivariate time-series sensor data  
- Feature engineering, rolling window aggregation, normalization  
- Model training & evaluation scripts  
- App / interface to upload new time-series and obtain RUL predictions  
- Modular code base so you can swap in different models or datasets

````

Here’s a brief of key files / directories:

- **data/raw/** — Raw datasets (e.g. as provided by challenge sources)  
- **data/processed/** — Cleaned, normalized, feature-engineered data ready for modeling  
- **src/train.py** — Training script (load data, train model, log metrics)  
- **src/evaluate.py** — Evaluate model performance, compute metrics  
- **src/inference.py** — Inference logic to predict RUL from new data  
- **app.py** — Simple frontend (e.g. Flask / Streamlit) to accept new input and return RUL  
- **outputs/** — Contains model checkpoints, prediction logs, plots, metrics  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above  
- Standard data science / ML libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch / TensorFlow, etc.)  
- (Optional) GPU for faster training  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepakMallesh/upskillcampus_turbofan.git
   cd upskillcampus_turbofan
````

2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

* Place raw dataset files (e.g. from C-MAPSS or other turbofan RUL datasets) into `data/raw/`.
* Run preprocessing / feature engineering scripts in `src/data_utils.py` (or a wrapper) to produce cleaned, normalized data in `data/processed/`.
* Ensure train/validation/test splits are defined (e.g. by engine id, cycles) for reliable evaluation.

### Training & Evaluation

Use `src/train.py` to train a model. Example:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

After training, use:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path outputs/best_model.pth \
    --test_data data/processed/test.csv
```

to compute performance metrics (e.g. RMSE, MAE, score used in prognostics challenges).

### Running Inference / Application

To predict RUL for new data:

```bash
python src/inference.py --model_path outputs/best_model.pth \
    --input_csv new_input.csv --output predictions.csv
```

To launch the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

This opens a UI (e.g. localhost) where you can upload or input time-series data and get back a predicted RUL.

## Model & Methods

You may experiment with:

* Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM / GRU)
* 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
* Transformer / Attention models for time-series
* Traditional ML (e.g. XGBoost, RandomForest) using hand-crafted features
* Ensembling methods

Hyperparameters, loss functions, and architecture details can be stored in a `configs/` directory or inside the training script.

## Usage Examples

Example commands:

```bash
# Train
python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml

# Evaluate
python src/evaluate.py --model_path outputs/checkpoint.pth --test_data data/processed/test.csv

# Inference
python src/inference.py --model_path outputs/final_model.pth --input_csv sample_input.csv

# Start app
python app.py
```

Make sure your input CSV format aligns (i.e. same columns as used during training: sensor readings, cycle numbers, etc.).

## Results & Metrics

You should record and present metrics like:

* **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
* **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
* **Prognostic score** (if following standard challenge metric)
* Plots showing predicted vs actual RUL
* Error distributions
* Case studies on specific engine units

Save them under `outputs/` along with model checkpoints.

## Future Work / Roadmap

* Increase model robustness (cross validation, regularization)
* Incorporate uncertainty estimates (e.g. Bayesian models, quantile regression)
* Extend to other fleets or datasets
* Deploy as a REST API / cloud service
* Add alerting / decision support integration
